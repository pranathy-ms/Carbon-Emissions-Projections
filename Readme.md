# Greenhouse Gas Emissions Forecasting with LSTM
This project predicts greenhouse gas emissions by sector using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The model is trained on historical emissions data and predicts future emissions for each sector. This document provides instructions on how to run the program, along with the required dependencies and setup steps.
